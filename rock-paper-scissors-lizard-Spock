# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock template


# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

# helper functions

# Convert string to number based on the above logic

# This function is formulated based on the logic that the numerical difference between 
# player's choice and computer's choice only ranges from -4 to 4 (player - computer)
# Within that range, if the difference is less than -2, the player wins.
# When the difference is either -2 or -1, the player loses.
# When the difference is 0, obviously it's a tie game.
# When the difference is either 1 or 2, the play wins.
# Anything beyond 2 means that the player loses.
# Again, a player's choice wins to 2 options before it and loses to 2 after it.
